	    Common Test adds the test suite directories to the code
	    path before executing the tests. These directories should
	    also be removed from the code path at the end of the test
	    run, which, prior to this fix, was not performed.</p>

	    An entry is now created in the index.html file (i.e. the
	    overview file for the test run) for each repeated test
	    during a test run. This was previously not the case. Note
	    that in the top level (logdir) index file, however, only
	    the last test result is listed. For example, given the
	    test spec:
	    [{merge_tests,false},{dirs,"test1"},{dirs,"test1"}]. In
	    the index file for the test run (under
	    Logdir/ct_run.Node.Date.Time), both tests are listed. In
	    the top level index file (under Logdir), only the last
	    test is listed (one has to find the previous results
	    through the all_runs.html file).</p>

	    After a test case timeout or abortion, the
	    end_per_testcase function executes on a new dedicated
	    process. The group leader for this process should be set
	    to the IO server for the test case, which was not done
	    properly. The result of this error was that no warnings
	    about end_per_testcase failing or timing out were ever
	    printed in the test case log. Also, help functions such
	    as e.g. test_server:stop_node/1, attempting to
	    synchronize with the IO server, would hang. The fault has
	    been corrected.</p>

	    The ct:get_status/0 function would cause the calling
	    process to receive 'DOWN' messages if no tests were
	    running at the time of the call. This bug has been fixed.</p>

	    A deadlock situation could occur if Common Test is

	    Two or more test cases executing in parallel and printing
	    to screen at the same time with ct:pal/2/3 or
	    ct:print/2/3 could write into each other's "slots" and
	    create a mess of mixed strings. In order to avoid this,
	    only a single IO message is now ever sent per printout
	    call.</p>

	    When a test case was killed because of a timetrap

	    Test Server and Common Test would add new error handlers
	    with each test run and fail to remove previously added
	    ones. In the case of Test Server, this would only happen
	    if SASL was not running on the test node. This has been
	    fixed.</p>

	    If a test case process was terminated due to an exit

	    When starting a test with ct_run and adding a directory
	    to the code path using -pa or -pz (preceding -erl_args),
	    Common Test would delete any existing directory in the
	    code path with the same base name (see
	    filename:basename/1) as the directory being added. This
	    has been fixed.</p>

	    Configuration data required by the group info function
	    was deleted before the call to post_end_per_group, which

          <p>
	    A new optional feature has been introduced that enables
	    Common Test to generate priv_dir directory names that are
	    unique for each test case or config function. The name of
	    the option/flag is 'create_priv_dir' and it can be set to
	    value 'auto_per_run' (which is the default, existing,
	    behaviour), or 'auto_per_tc' or 'manual_per_tc'. If
	    'auto_per_tc' is used, Test Server creates a dedicated
	    priv_dir automatically for each test case (which can be
	    very expensive in case of many and/or repeated cases). If
	    'manual_per_tc' is used, the user needs to create the
	    priv_dir explicitly by calling the new function
	    ct:make_priv_dir/0.</p>

	    It is now possible to use the post_end_per_testcase CT
	    hook function to print a comment for a test case in the

	    Common Test will now print error information (with a time
	    stamp) in the test case log file immediately when a test

	    The test specification term 'skip_groups' was implemented
	    in Common Test v1.6. It was never documented however,

	    If the init_per_group/2 and end_per_group/2 functions are
	    not implemented in the test suite, Common Test calls it's
	    own local init- and end functions - previously named
	    ct_init_per_group/2 and ct_end_per_group/2 - when a group
	    is executed. These functions have been renamed
	    init_per_group/2 and end_per_group/2 respectively. Note
	    that this may affect any user event handler identifying
	    events by the old names.</p>

	    By specifying a user defined function ({M,F,A} or fun) as

	    The test case group info function has been implemented in
	    Common Test. Before execution of a test case group, a
	    call is now made to <c>TestSuite:group(GroupName)</c>.
	    The function returns a list of test properties, e.g. to
	    specify timetrap values, require configuration data, etc
	    (analogue to the test suite- and test case info
	    function). The scope of the properties set by
	    <c>group(GroupName)</c> is all test cases and sub-groups
	    of group <c>GroupName</c>.</p>

	    Common Test hooks are now in a final supported version.
	    The Common Test hooks allow you to abstract out
	    initialization behaviour that is common to multiple test
	    suites into one place and also extend the behaviour of a
	    suite without changing the suite itself. For more
	    information see the Common Test user's guide.</p>

	    A new built-in common test hook has been added which

	    Common Test now calls info functions also for the
	    <c>init/end_per_suite/1</c> and
	    <c>init/end_per_group/2</c> configuration functions.
	    These can be used e.g. to set timetraps and require
	    external configuration data relevant only for the
	    configuration functions in question (without affecting
	    properties set for groups and test cases in the suite).
	    The info function for <c>init/end_per_suite(Config)</c>
	    is <c>init/end_per_suite()</c>, and for
	    <c>init/end_per_group(GroupName,Config)</c> it's
	    <c>init/end_per_group(GroupName)</c>. Info functions can
	    not be used with <c>init/end_per_testcase(TestCase,
	    Config)</c>, since these configuration functions execute
	    on the test case process and will use the same properties
	    as the test case (i.e. properties set by the test case
	    info function, <c>TestCase()</c>).</p>

	    It's now possible to read the full name of the test case

	    lookup it up as value of the key <c>tc_logfile</c> in the
	    test case <c>Config</c> list (which means it can also be
	    read by a pre- or post Common Test hook function). The
	    data is also sent with the event
	    <c>#event{name=tc_logfile,data={{Suite,Func},LogFileName}}</c>,
	    and can be read by any installed event handler.</p>

	    Printouts to stdout may be captured during test case
	    execution. This is useful in order to e.g. read and parse
	    tty printouts from the SUT during test case execution (if
	    necessary, say, to determine the outcome of the test).
	    The capturing session is started with
	    <c>ct:capture_start/0</c>, and stopped with
	    <c>ct:capture_stop/0</c>. The list of buffered strings is
	    read and purged with <c>ct:capture_get/0/1</c>. It's
	    possible to filter out printouts made with
	    <c>ct:log/2/3</c> and <c>ct:pal/2/3</c> from the captured
	    list of strings. This is done by calling
	    <c>capture_get/1</c> with a list of log categories to
	    exclude.</p>

	    The syntax for specifying test case groups in the all/0
	    list has been extended to include execution properties
	    for both groups and sub-groups. The properties specified
	    in all/0 for a group overrides the properties specified
	    in the group declaration (in groups/0). The main purpose
	    of this extension is to make it possible to run the same
	    set of tests, but with different properties, without
	    having to declare copies of the group in question. Also,
	    the same syntax may be used in test specifications in
	    order to change properties of groups at the time of
	    execution, without having to edit the test suite. Please
	    see the User's Guide for details and examples.</p>

	    If a timetrap timeout occured during execution of of a

	    or indirectly from a test case), the Suite argument in

	    Corrections of the vts mode. It will now report errors
	    (about e.g. incorrect config files) instead of crashing
	    or hanging. Furthermore, the requirement that the test
	    directory name must have a "_test" suffix has been
	    removed. Also, a workaround has been implemented for the
	    limitation that the file browser (in many web browsers)
	    will only return the basic file name, not the full
	    directory path (which made it impossible to have config
	    files in other directories than the main test directory).</p>

	    The timetrap handling has been made more user
	    controllable by means of new start options and new ct
	    interface functions. With the 'multiply_timetraps' start
	    option, it's possible to specify a value which all
	    timetrap timeout values get multiplied by. This is useful
	    e.g. to extend the timetraps temporarily while running
	    cover or trace. The 'scale_timetraps' start option
	    switches on or off the Test Server timetrap scaling
	    feature (which tries to detect if the tests may benefit
	    from extended timetraps, e.g. due to running certain test
	    tools, and performs the scaling automatically).
	    Furthermore, the ct:timetrap/1 function has been
	    introduced, which makes it possible to set/reset
	    timetraps during test execution. Also, a ct:sleep/1
	    function is now available, which takes the timetrap
	    parameters into account when calculating the time to
	    suspend the process.</p>

	    The telnet client in Common Test sent [IAC,DO,NOP] to the
	    server in attempt to keep the connection alive. This is
	    not a valid sequence according to the standard, and some
	    telnet servers would terminate the connection because of
	    it. The client has been changed to send [IAC,NOP] every
	    10 secs instead, which should be a valid sequence. The
	    client does not negotiate this type of "keep alive"
	    message with the server, and if it causes problems, the
	    user may disable the keep alive feature by adding
	    {keep_alive,false} to the telnet configuration data for
	    the server/connection. Please see the ct_telnet and
	    unix_telnet manual pages for details.</p>

	    the user specifies with e.g. the 'dir' start flag/option.</p>

	    Test case groups have been introduced. With this feature
	    it's possible to execute groups (possibly nested) of test
	    cases, each group wrapped with a call to function
	    init_per_group/2 and end_per_group/2. Group definitions
	    are done by means of the new call-back function groups/0,
	    which should return a list of definitions. A group
	    definition contains a name tag, a list of properties and
	    a list of test cases (including possible nested group
	    definitions). The properties make it possible to execute
	    test cases in parallel, in sequence and in shuffled
	    order. It is also possible to repeat test cases according
	    to different criterias. The properties can be combined,
	    making it possible to e.g. repeat a conf case a certain
	    number of times and execute the test cases in different
	    (random) order every time. Available properties are:
	    parallel, sequence, shuffle, repeat, repeat_until_all_ok,
	    repeat_until_any_ok, repeat_until_any_fail and
	    repeat_until_all_fail. Please see the Common Test User's

            When running a test which includes all suites in a test
            directory, if the auto compilation would fail for one

            test. This was an unwanted behaviour and has been

            only the failing ones excluded from the test (and logged

            return all matching values for the variable. The order of

            Because a telnet connection was always identified by a
            config variable alias, it was impossible to open multiple
            connections using the same telnet host data entry in the
            config file. This limitation has been removed by making
            it possible to associate a connection with handle value
            only (i.e. multiple connections may be opened using the
            same config variable). See ct_telnet:open/4 for details.</p>

            A new syntax for defining default config data values has
            been introduced. In previous versions of Common Test, to
            define and access a default value for a config variable
            (in the suite info- or test case info function), an alias
            name had to be used. With the new syntax you may define
            default values without reference to aliases, like this:
            {default_config,VarName,DefaultValue}. Please see the
            User's Guide for more info.</p>

          <p>
            In previous versions of Common Test, whenever a config
            variable got associated with a name (by means of a
            require statement), the config variable name was replaced
            with the new name. This introduced unwanted dependencies
            between test cases (e.g. if one test case would introduce
            a new name, the following test cases could no longer
            access the config data by means of the original
            variable). This functionality has now been updated so
            that when new names are introduced with require, they
            become aliases (references) instead of replacements.
            Hence, config data elements can always, at any time, be
            accessed by means of the original config variable names.</p>

	    Common Test now uses the re application instead of the
	    previous rx driver to perform regular expression matching
	    on telnet strings. Since re works on all supported
	    operating systems, it is now possible to run telnet
	    sessions also on platforms such as e.g. Windows (which
	    was not the case with the previous rx driver). Note that
	    the rx driver is obsolete from now on, and will be
	    removed from Common Test after OTP R12B.</p>

	    It is now possible, by means of the new function
	    ct:abort_current_testcase/1 or
	    test_server_ctrl:abort_current_testcase/1, to abort the
	    currently executing test case.</p>

	    The configure test of the rx lib in Common Test was not
	    performed during the general OTP application
	    configuration phase. This made e.g. autoconf impossible.
	    This has been changed to correspond with the normal OTP
	    build procedure.</p>

	    The rx library, included with common_test, failed to
	    build on on some architectures because the -fPIC compiler
	    option was missing.</p>
