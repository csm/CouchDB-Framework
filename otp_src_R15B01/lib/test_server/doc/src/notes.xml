          <p>
	    After a test case timeout or abortion, the
	    end_per_testcase function executes on a new dedicated
	    process. The group leader for this process should be set
	    to the IO server for the test case, which was not done
	    properly. The result of this error was that no warnings
	    about end_per_testcase failing or timing out were ever
	    printed in the test case log. Also, help functions such
	    as e.g. test_server:stop_node/1, attempting to
	    synchronize with the IO server, would hang. The fault has
	    been corrected.</p>

	    A deadlock situation could occur if Common Test is
	    forwarding error_handler printouts to Test Server at the
	    same time a new test case is starting. This error has
	    been fixed.</p>

	    When a test case was killed because of a timetrap
	    timeout, the current location (suite, case and line) was
	    not printed correctly in the log files. This has been

	    Test Server and Common Test would add new error handlers
	    with each test run and fail to remove previously added
	    ones. In the case of Test Server, this would only happen
	    if SASL was not running on the test node. This has been

	    If a test case process was terminated due to an exit

	    framework. This has been corrected.</p>

          <p>
	    A new optional feature has been introduced that enables
	    Common Test to generate priv_dir directory names that are
	    unique for each test case or config function. The name of
	    the option/flag is 'create_priv_dir' and it can be set to
	    value 'auto_per_run' (which is the default, existing,
	    behaviour), or 'auto_per_tc' or 'manual_per_tc'. If
	    'auto_per_tc' is used, Test Server creates a dedicated
	    priv_dir automatically for each test case (which can be
	    very expensive in case of many and/or repeated cases). If
	    'manual_per_tc' is used, the user needs to create the
	    priv_dir explicitly by calling the new function
	    ct:make_priv_dir/0.</p>

	    It is now possible to use the post_end_per_testcase CT
	    hook function to print a comment for a test case in the
	    overview log file, even if the test case gets killed by a
	    timetrap or unknown exit signal, or if the
	    end_per_testcase function times out.</p>

          <p>
	    Common Test will now print error information (with a time
	    stamp) in the test case log file immediately when a test
	    case fails. This makes it easier to see when, in time,
	    the fault actually occured, and aid the job of locating
	    relevant trace and debug printouts in the log.</p>

	    By specifying a user defined function ({M,F,A} or fun) as
	    timetrap value, either by means of an info function or by
	    calling ct:timetrap/1, it is now possible to set a
	    timetrap that will be triggered when the user function
	    returns.</p>

	    If the optional configuration functions init_per_suite/1
	    and end_per_suite/1 are not implemented in the test
	    suite, local Common Test versions of these functions are
	    called instead, and will be displayed in the overview log
	    file. Any printouts made by the pre- or
	    post_init_per_suite and pre- or post_end_per_suite hook
	    functions are saved in the log files for these functions.</p>

	    The test case group info function has been implemented in
	    Common Test. Before execution of a test case group, a
	    call is now made to <c>TestSuite:group(GroupName)</c>.
	    The function returns a list of test properties, e.g. to
	    specify timetrap values, require configuration data, etc
	    (analogue to the test suite- and test case info
	    function). The scope of the properties set by
	    <c>group(GroupName)</c> is all test cases and sub-groups
	    of group <c>GroupName</c>.</p>

	    If a timetrap timeout occured during execution of of a
	    function in a lib module (i.e. a function called directly
	    or indirectly from a test case), the Suite argument in

	    correctly contain the name of the test suite, but the lib
	    module. (This would only happen if the lib module was
	    compiled with ct.hrl included). This error has been
	    solved.</p>

	    A new option, 'logopts', has been introduced, to make it
	    possible to modify some aspects of the logging behaviour
	    in Common Test (or Test Server). For example, whenever an
	    io printout is made, test_server adds newline (\n) to the
	    end of the output string. This may not always be a
	    preferred action and can therefore be disabled by means
	    of "ct_run ... -logopts no_nl" (or ct:run_test([...,
	    {logopts,[no_nl]}])). A new framework callback function,
	    get_logopts/0, has been introduced (see the ct_framework

	    When running tests with auto-compilation disabled, Common
	    Test could only display the test suite source code on
	    html format in the test case log if the source file was
	    located in the same directory as the pre-compiled suite.
	    This has been modified so that Common Test now tries to
	    locate the source file by means of the test suite module
	    info (Suite:module_info/1). As a result, a suite may now
	    be compiled to a different output directory (e.g.
	    $MYTEST/bin) than the source code directory (e.g.
	    $MYTEST/src), without the source-code-to-html generation

	    Test Server will now call the end_per_testcase/2 function
	    even if the test case has been terminated explicitly
	    (with abort_current_testcase/1), or after a timetrap
	    timeout. Under these circumstances the return value of
	    end_per_testcase is completely ignored. Therefore the
	    function will not be able to change the reason for test
	    case termination by returning {fail,Reason}, nor will it
	    be able to save data with {save_config,Data}.</p>

	    Previously, a repeat property of a test case group
	    specified the number of times the group should be
	    repeated after the main test run. I.e. {repeat,N} would
	    case the group to execute 1+N times. To be consistent
	    with the behaviour of the run_test repeat option, this
	    has been changed. N now specifies the absolute number of
	    executions instead.</p>

	    The conf case in Test Server has been extended with
	    properties that make it possible to execute test cases in
	    parallel, in sequence and in shuffled order. It is now
	    also possible to repeat test cases according to different
	    criterias. The properties can be combined, making it
	    possible to e.g. repeat a conf case a certain number of
	    times and execute the test cases in different (random)
	    order every time. The properties are specified in a list
	    in the conf case definition: {conf, Properties, InitCase,
	    TestCases, EndCase}. The available properties are:
	    parallel, sequence, shuffle, repeat, repeat_until_all_ok,
	    repeat_until_any_ok, repeat_until_any_fail,
	    repeat_until_all_fail.</p>

	    Test Server is a portable test server for automated
	    application testing. The server can run test suites on
	    local or remote targets and log progress and results to
	    HTML pages. The main purpose of Test Server is to act as
	    engine inside customized test tools. A callback interface
	    for such framework applications is provided.</p>
